</ul>

<p><strong><em>To use this document, you should have a basic familiarity with software development and web services</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This document is structured like a cook book. We present common api methods and use cases which can be accessed through the navigation menu.</p>

<p>For more details, please refer to the <a href="/assets/docs/Temando_API_R1_17_Developers_Guide_CA.PDF" target="_blank">Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or need help, please feel free to drop us a line at <a href="mailto:api-support@temando.com">api-support@temando.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id='a-idcommon_processesprocesses-overviewa'><a id="common_processes">Processes Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Temando fulfilment process consists of several interconnected steps that need to occur in sequence. A typical
fulfilment process consists of the following steps: get quotes, make a booking, get manifest, confirm manifest, then track the booked consignment.</p>

<p>Combined, these steps will enable an integration to provide Temando powered fulfilment services that can offer your customers shipment
quotes, bookings, as well as transfer these bookings to the chosen carrier (manifest). Temando will also enable the tracking of
these packages by making accessible a consignment&rsquo;s full tracking history.</p>

<p>From the customer perspective, the fulfilment process enables the following use case in a shopping cart scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer selects an item from your store.</li>
<li>Customer obtains a shipment quote by entering details about their desired delivery location, for example: suburb/city and post code.</li>
<li>Customer presses &ldquo;Get a quote&rdquo; button, which will send a <a href="#getQuotes">getQuotes</a> request to Temando.</li>
<li>Temando returns a list of possible quotes. This list depends on the number of carriers that were configured for the shopping cart client.</li>
<li>Customer accepts the quote with a carrier.</li>
<li>Customer pays for the order, which will send a <a href="#makeBooking">makeBooking</a> request to Temando.</li>
<li>Temando sends a request to the selected carrier, which will start the process of shipping the product.</li>
<li>Customer can track the order after they have been shipped, either through <a href="http://www.temando.com/education/track-your-item" target="_blank">Temando tracking portal</a> or through a portal built for your store.</li>
</ul>

<p><br/> 
From the developer perspective, the fulfilment process enables the following use case:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/soap/process_overview.png"/></p>

<ul>
<li>Your system can invoke Temando&rsquo;s <a href="#getQuotes">getQuotes</a> to check what quotes are available based on particular request parameters.</li>
<li>Your system can invoke <a href="#makeBooking">makeBooking</a> to book in a request with a carrier using one of the available quotes.</li>
<li>If your Temando account has <a href="#what-is-manifesting">manifesting</a> set up with the carrier, then your system can run <a href="#getManifest">getManifest</a> to verify all booked shipments are ready for a particular date. This step is optional.</li>
<li>Your system can invoke <a href="#confirmManifest">confirmManifest</a> to confirm that all are ready.</li>
<li>Your system can invoke <a href="#getRequest">getRequest</a> to track the items after they have been shipped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are detailed explanation of each of these steps. Note that examples of the actual elements and their values are available within the operation descriptions.</p>
<h3 id='a-idprocess_getquotesa'><a id="process_getQuotes"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Get Quotes</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to identify what quotes are available. To achieve this a call must be made to the <a href="#getQuotes">getQuotes</a> operation and provide the particulars of the request that needs to be sent. These particulars are grouped as follows:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Anythings</strong></td>
<td>Details about the item/s to be included in the consignment, including packaging type, dimensions, weights, and articles contained inside the packaging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Anywhere</strong></td>
<td>Details about where the item/s are being sent from/to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Anytime</strong></td>
<td>Details about when the item/s are ready for pickup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>General</strong></td>
<td>Other general details about the item/s are being sent (eg. goods value).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Once this operation has been processed, the response will contain a list of available quotes. For each quote returned, the following information is provided:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Quote</strong></td>
<td>General information for the quote, such as price, delivery time, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Adjustments</strong></td>
<td>List of adjustments that will be applied based on the payment method used at the booking stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Inclusions</strong></td>
<td>If there are any inclusions associated with the quote (eg. tracking available, instant booking, etc). These incur no extra expense as they are included in the quote price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Extras</strong></td>
<td>If there are any extras available for the quote (eg. insurance, etc). These are an extra expense and will be added to the quote price if selected in the booking step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Carrier</strong></td>
<td>Information about the carrier service.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id='a-idprocesses_makebookinga'><a id="processes_makeBooking"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Make a Booking</strong></p>

<p>Once the available quotes have been provided and the required quote identified, a booking must be made to register the request and the identified quote. To achieve this a call must be made to the <a href="#makeBooking">makeBooking</a> operation. The information required for this call is grouped as follows:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Anythings, Anywhere, Anytime, General</strong></td>
<td>This is the exact same details as what was provided in the <a href="#process_getQuotes">Get Quotes</a> call in the previous step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Origin</strong></td>
<td>The specific details about where an item/s is being sent from or the originating address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Destination</strong></td>
<td>The specific details about where an item/s is being sent to or the final destination address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Quote</strong></td>
<td>This will include: <ul><li>The specific details about the accepted quote.</li><li>The extras to be included with the quote (eg. insurance, etc).</li></ul> These must match exactly with the details provided in the response to the <a href="#process_getQuotes">Get Quotes</a> call in the previous step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Payment</strong></td>
<td>The payment details for the payment of the quote.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Instructions</strong></td>
<td>Delivery instructions that should be communicated to the driver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Comments</strong></td>
<td>General comments relating to the request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>PromotionCode</strong></td>
<td>Temando code used for promotional partners.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Once this operation has been processed, the response will contain the following information:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Request Id</strong></td>
<td>The unique Temando id for this booking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Booking Number</strong></td>
<td>The carrier&rsquo;s booking number for the request. This is only provided if it was detailed as an inclusion for the quote that was accepted from step 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Consignment Details</strong></td>
<td>This will include the consignment number, consignment document and document type. This is only provided if it was detailed as an inclusion for the quote that was accepted from step 1.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id='a-idprocesses_manifestinga'><a id="processes_manifesting"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Get Manifest</strong></p>

<p>Manifesting is the process of the merchant confirming that a collection of shipments are ready for pick up by a carrier. This is only available if you have registered your pickup location for manifesting. For further information, please see our section on <a href="#what-is-manifesting">What is Manifesting</a>.</p>

<p>Before confirming a manifest it is likely you may want to verify that all shipments which have been booked are actually ready for pickup. The <a href="#getManifest">getManifest</a> operation can be called with the request type <strong>Awaiting Confirmation</strong> to get a list of items that would be confirmed by a <a href="#confirmManifest">confirmManifest</a> call.</p>
<h3 id='a-idprocesses_confirmmanifesta'><a id="processes_confirmManifest"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Step 4 - Confirm Manifest</strong></p>

<p>Items which are ready for pickup can be confirmed by a call to the <a href="#confirmManifest">confirmManifest</a> operation. Doing so will cause Temando to ask the relevant carrier to dispatch to your location for a pick up. Further, shipments can no longer be cancelled via a Temando API once this has been confirmed, as the carrier has been instructed to pickup the items. Cancellations must be negotiated with the carrier after a manifest has been confirmed. After a manifest is confirmed, it can be retrieved using the <a href="#getManifest">getManifest</a> operation with the request type <strong>Confirmed</strong>.</p>
<h3 id='a-idprocesses_trackinga'><a id="processes_tracking"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Step 5 - Tracking</strong></p>

<p>Tracking the status of a shipment can be performed by making a call to the <a href="#getRequest">getRequest</a> operation. This will return the request and associated details based on the supplied request id. </p>

<p>The <a href="#getRequest">getRequest</a> operation can also be used to retrieve a label in case it wasn&rsquo;t captured in the <a href="#makeBooking">makeBooking</a> response.</p>

<h2 id='a-idsoap_wsdlsoap-wsdla'><a id="soap_wsdl">Soap Wsdl</a></h2>
<p>To invoke the Soap services, you need to load the Wsdl file into your client application.</p>

<p>Temando provides the Soap services on 2 separate environments.
You should test with the demo environment during your application development / testing phases.
After you&rsquo;ve completed testing, your application needs to be updated to point to Temando&rsquo;s production environment.</p>

<p>The Soap services locations are below:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Environment</th>
<th>Wsdl location</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Demo</td>
<td><a href="http://api-demo.temando.com/schema/2009_06/server.wsdl" target="_blank">http://api-demo.temando.com/schema/2009_06/server.wsdl</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Production</td>
<td><a href="https://api.temando.com/schema/2009_06/server.wsdl" target="_blank">https://api.temando.com/schema/2009_06/server.wsdl</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Demo Wsdl and production Wsdl are almost the same, except for namespaces (one points to <em>api-demo.temando.com</em> and the other points to <em>api.temando.com</em>)</p>

<h2 id='a-idapi_credentialsapi-credentialsa'><a id="api_credentials">API Credentials</a></h2>
<p>To make calls to Temando API, you must have a client account with Temando.</p>

<p>Each web service request needs to include the account&rsquo;s user name and password in the request header (see <a href="#api_overview">API Overview</a> for an example of a Soap request message).</p>

<p>For the demo environment, the below accounts could be used:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Client Id</th>
<th>User name</th>
<th>Password</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>20420</td>
<td>TEMANDOTEST</td>
<td>temandopass1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>59010</td>
<td>TEMANDOTEST_INSURANCE</td>
<td>temandopass1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>59012</td>
<td>TEMANDOTEST_MANIFESTING</td>
<td>temandopass1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>59014</td>
<td>TEMANDOTEST_MANIFESTING_INSURANCE</td>
<td>temandopass1</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

As these accounts are shared, others could potentially see your test bookings. Please make sure that you do not include any sensitive data in your tests.

<h1 id='a-idfaqfrequently-asked-questionsa'><a id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>

<p><a id="what-is-manifesting"></a>
<p class="question">What is Manifesting?</p></p>

<p>Manifesting is a service we can specifically enable for clients who have agreed to / meet certain volumes of freight and / or have arranged a permanent pick-up in place.  This service needs to be activated / enabled on your account per carrier(s) who support the manifesting capability.</p>

<p>From a technical aspect, when <strong>manifesting</strong> is enabled - Temando will store all booked shipments internally with a status of <strong>awaiting collection</strong>. This status is only changed to <strong>complete</strong> when <a href="#confirmManifest">confirmManifest</a> has been called and it is ONLY at this point where we send the carrier the shipment data. When <strong>manifesting</strong> is NOT enabled, each individual booking is parsed immediately to the relevant carriers platform upon the <a href="#makeBooking">makeBooking</a> request.</p>

<p><aside class="notice">
It is also important to be aware that when <strong>manifesting</strong> is enabled, individual pick-up notifications are NOT sent to the relevant carrier upon the booking request. This therefore means that if a location does not have a permanent pick-up in place, and a shipment is booked with a carrier set to manifesting - there is a very probable possibility that the carrier will not be aware of the booked shipment, thus possibly delaying the collection.
</aside></p>

<p>Following on from the above, cancelling shipments via the API can only be performed when a shipment has the status of <strong>awaiting collection</strong> (manifesting is enabled &amp; is being stored in Temando). Any booked shipments that have already been parsed to the relevant carrier (ADHOC bookings) will need to be manually cancelled &amp; credited back by the Temando support team liaising with the appropriate carrier (as it is no longer sitting in Temando).</p>

<p>Each <strong>Saved Address</strong> (origin) on your Temando Account should be assigned a unique <strong>Location</strong> entry in your manifesting portal. These are saved and sorted by the unique <strong>Reference</strong> description (which also links manifesting to your API).  The more saved addresses you have (even with the exact same details), the more origin points in your manifesting location list.</p>

<p><a id="what-is-packaging-optimisation"></a>
<p class="question">What is Packaging Optimisation?</p></p>

<p>Temando&rsquo;s packaging logic / optimisation places the consolidated product dimensions, in the most relevant pre-configured package, in the respective Temando account.
The logic takes into consideration both the spatial &amp; volumetric measurements.</p>

<p>Dimensions of the pre-configured packaging include <em>actual</em> (outside physical dimensions) and <em>available</em> (inside physical dimension). The <em>actual</em> are the dimensions used for calculating freight cost, while <em>available</em> are used to identify available space for packing.</p>

<p>Packaging order (prioritisation) is based off the size of the packaging itself, that is, the smallest packaging will be used first and then incrementally as the packaging sizes increase. This can however be overridden with a priority assignment to the packaging, to enable larger packaging to be used before smaller ones.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Box01 configured at 45 x 45 x 35 (L x W x H)</li>
<li>  The article/product configured with 30 x 20 x 6</li>
<li>  This order will have a quantity of 10</li>
</ul>

<p>Temando packaging logic results:</p>

<ul>
<li>  You can stack 5 boxes high and stay within the 35cm height limit (height of articles is 6cm x 5 boxes), and</li>
<li>  You can stack another 5 boxes behind the first set and not breach the width of 45cm (two boxes deep is 20cm x 2)</li>
</ul>

<p><img title="Packacking" alt="Packaging" src="../assets/images/soap/packaging.png" /></p>

<p>Alternatively if you calculate it cubically = Box01 = 45 x 45 x 35 = 70,875 cubic cm, made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li>  10 articles consume 30 x 20 x 6 = 36,000 cubic cm</li>
<li>  Waste above the boxes = 6,000 cubic cm (30 x 40 x 5)</li>
<li>  Waste at the back of the boxes = 5,250 cubic cm (30 x 5 x 35)</li>
<li>  Waste to the right of the boxes = 23,625 cubic cm (15 x 35 x 45)</li>
</ul>

<p class="question">What is the difference between getQuotes and getQuotesByRequest?</p>

<p>They offer the same functionalities. However, you are advised to use <strong>getQuotes</strong>. Its predecessor <strong>getQuotesByRequest</strong> will be deprecated sometime in the future.</p>

<p class="question">What is the difference between makeBooking and makeBookingByRequest?</p>

<p><strong>makeBooking</strong> is used for domestic shipping whereas <strong>makeBookingByRequest</strong> is used for international shipping.</p>

<p class="question">For the makeBooking response, does Temando provide tracking details like a tracking number or a URL that we can provide to our clients so they can track their item?</p>

<p>The <strong>consignment number</strong> that we provide in the makeBooking response can be used to track the parcels on the carrier&rsquo;s tracking website.</p>

<p>Alternatively the <strong>requestId</strong> that is returned can be used to track the items in <a href="http://www.temando.com/education/track-your-item" target="_blank">Temando portal</a></p>

<p class="question">How do I get a list of registered locations for my account?</p>

<p>You could call <strong>getLocations</strong> service to get this information.</p>

<p class="question" id="create-api-account">How do I create an account to use the API on production?</p>

<p>First, you need to create an account via <a href="https://dashboard.temando.com" target="_blank">our website</a>.
Once done, on the <em>My Details</em> section you will need to select which <em>Account Type</em> i.e. payment method you would like to use for your transactions with our API.
Then please contact the Temando solution manager assigned to your account, and they will sort out the rest.</p>

<p class="question">Is there a quick way to test Temando Soap API without wring any code?</p>

<p>SoapUI is a well known tool for web service testing. A freeware version (including open source) is available for download from the internet.
With this tool you will be able to replicate the requests and responses that you will send and receive when using the Temando API from a code base.
The soapUI tool is available from <a href="http://www.soapui.org/" target="_blank">http://www.soapui.org/</a>.</p>

<p>For help on how to setup SoapUI, please refer to Appendix A in the <a href="/assets/docs/Temando_API_R1_17_Developers_Guide_CA.PDF" target="_blank">Developer Guide</a></p>

<p>Communication with the API uses a simple request/response protocol based on Soap requests over a HTTP transport layer. The request message is submitted to the API server with a POST request to the API URI - the server responds with the response message as the content body.</p>

<p>Currently the only recognized header is the WS-Security Security header.</p>

<table><thead>

If the header is omitted, or is present but specifies no character encoding, the message MUST be encoded in UTF-8. Note that irrespective of the message&rsquo;s encoding, the contents of the message must be mappable to the HP Roman-8 character set. Currently supported character sets are UTF-8, UTF-16 (big or little endian), ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII.</td>

<p>The response body is similar but does not currently include any Soap headers.</p>

<p>Errors caused by an invalid request message will generate a Soap fault in the response body and the operation will have no further effect (see section 2.6 SOAP Faults in the <a href="../assets/docs/Temando_API_R1_17_Developers_Guide_CA.PDF">Developer Guide</a> for a list of standard fault codes).</p>

<p>User authentication is performed using the WS-Security standard Soap headers, which must be included in every request message. Presently only username/password authentication is supported; however support for SSL certificate based authentication and signed xml are intended for a future release. Users may further be restricted by IP address.</p>

<p>An accepted security header consists of a single Security element containing exactly one <strong>UsernameToken</strong>, which in turn contains <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> elements. The <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> elements in turn supply the user credentials in plain text (for this reason, an SSL connection is required for transport-level security).</p>

<p>If authentication fails for whatever reason, the server will return a <strong>Soap Fault</strong> indicating the failure as defined within section 2.6 SOAP Faults in the <a href="../assets/docs/Temando_API_R1_17_Developers_Guide_CA.PDF">Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id='general'>General</h2>

<p>There are currently no restrictions or limitations on the service requests themselves or returned data (eg. maximum number of quotes, etc.) but this may change in the future.</p>

<h1 id='a-idcreatelocationcreatelocationa'><a id="createLocation">createLocation</a></h1>

<p>The createLocation operation registers a location that can have attached stock levels, facilities, and carrier account information.</p>

<p>A stored location is required for a range of carriers to associate carrier information with the location.</p>

<p>A stored location could be used as origin or destination location when getting a quote or making a booking, instead of specifying the full address.</p>

<p>All carriers that are set to manifest must book against a stored location and manifest against that stored location.</p>

<p>On success, the response is an empty createLocationResponse.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a SoapFault is thrown with the details of the exception (see section 2.6 Soap Faults in the <a href="../assets/docs/Temando_API_R1_17_Developers_Guide_CA.PDF">Developer Guide</a>).</p>

<p>The confirmManifest operation registers those requests that match the supplied parameters as being confirmed and ready to send.  If a confirmedReadyDate is supplied all matching requests are updated to have this new send date.</p>

<p>The response message is a confirmManifestResponse, and contains the manifest documents (and label documents, if requested).</p>

<p>If a query contains invalid data then a SoapFault is thrown with the details of the exception (see section 2.6 Soap Faults in the <a href="../assets/docs/Temando_API_R1_17_Developers_Guide_CA.PDF">Developer Guide</a>).</p>
